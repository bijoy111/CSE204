//There is an abstract class "list" in stackADT.h header file whose  member functions are declared as pure virtual function. we use C++ template to support various types 
  of elements
//stackArr.h header file contain a derived class "alist" that implements the "list" base class. In this class the list  allocate memory dynamically.
//stackLL.h header file contain a class "Link" for the node of the list. Every node has a value and a pointer to point the next node. The stackLL.h header file also contain 
  the derived class "llist" that implements the list base class.
//1array2stack.h header file contain a derived class "oneArrtwostack" that implements the "list" base class.It uses one array to work with two stack.
//stackmain.cpp file import the header files stackADT.h,stackArr.h,stackLL.h. It takes input as described in question and give the corresponding output using the methods of stackArr.h and stackLL.h files.
  It has print function to print the output.
//dishwasher.cpp file also import the header files stackADT.h,stackArr.h,stackLL.h. It takes input as described in question and give the corresponding output using its print function.
